Overview
--------
The repository provides a Leaflet <<x1,[1]>> based web frontend to the Open Source Routing Machine (Project-OSRM <<x2,[2]>>).
The frontend is implemented in Javascript.
Data is fetched from routing and geocoding servers using JSONP queries.
The website is XHTML 1.0 Strict compliant.
A deployed version of the the web frontend can be seen at <<x3,[3]>>.


Setup
-----
The frontend should work directly as provided.
Several settings - including the URL for the routing server and the geocoder server - can be specified in +OSRM.config.js+.
Different tile servers can be specified in +OSRM.main.js+.
Note that the URL shortener used for generating route links only works with URLs pointing to the official Project-OSRM website.


Branches
--------
- The +master+ branch will always point to the latest released version of the frontend.
- The +develop+ branch should always point to a working version that incorporates new features and bugfixes (think of it like a nightly-build).
- Other branches contain various work in progress.


Bugtracking
-----------
Please use the OSRM-Project bug tracker for submitting any bug reports or feature requests.


Integration into Project-OSRM repository
----------------------------------------
The Project-OSRM repository already contains the frontend repository as a submodule.
It will always point to the latest deployed version.
To successfully work a repository that contains submodules, use the following git commands (available in git 1.7.1+):

+git clone --recursive+::
to clone a repository and the contained submodules

+git pull && git submodule update+::
to pull the latest version of the repository and update its submodules if required

Note that the frontend can also be checked out independently of the Project-OSRM repository.
